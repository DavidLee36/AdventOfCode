# Advent of Code Solutions

This is my personal repository to track my Advent of Code solutions throughout the years. Hopefully I stick with it!

## Goals

- **Improve data structures and algorithm skills**: Practice implementing efficient solutions to challenging problems
- **Get comfortable with languages I don't use often**: Use AoC as an opportunity to work with different programming languages and become more proficient

## Structure

Solutions are organized by year in directories like `aoc2025/`, `aoc2024/`, etc. Each year contains:
- Individual solution files for each day
- Input files in the `inputs/` directory
- Project/build files for the language used that year

## Progress

- **2025**: In progress (C#)
